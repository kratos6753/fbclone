## Things that I learned by doing

##### QSA in htaccess is Query String Append
##### L in htaccess means if rule matches then don't process the rules below this line
##### Learned about Reflection class introduced in PHP5 (>= 5.3.2) useful for testing private methods
##### I knew TDD long back, but practising it now
##### Using fixtures to setup the state of the code for testing purposes
##### Added pre-commit Hook for commiting code only after passing tests
